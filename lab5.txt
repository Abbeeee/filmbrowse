  REST API's
===============================

API's are used to make it easier for various systems to communicate and send data to each
other in ways that is understandable for them. It also makes it so that a user can access
parts easier through the interface. REST in turn specifies how and what rules an API has.
Such rules could be what types of data users are able to get from the API and/or if they
are allowed to update/delete data. It could also define if you need to authenticate to
access data. A REST API normally also comes with some kind of documentation to let the 
user know how to interact with it.

An real life scenario is where you can use the google maps API to retrieve exact coordinates 
for cities. These also requires an authentication to be able to retrieve data. Another is 
where you can use Githubs API to retrieve information about users, like accessing data 
about their repositories. Here it can also be used to create new repositories, 
this, however, requires an authentication.

set $url = https://catfact.ninja/fact?max_length=50

set option for ($curl_connection, CURLOPT_URL, $url) specifies the url
set option for ($curl_connection, CURLOPT_RETU+4RNTRANSFER, true) makes it return a string instead of output directly

excecute/run the ($curl_connection) save as $response

$response return json file (most api's do)
json_decode($response, true) returns array and save it as $jsonResponse

display $jsonResponse on webpage

curl_close($curl_connection) when done with the curl
